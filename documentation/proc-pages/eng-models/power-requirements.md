# Power Requirements

Figure 1 shows a simplified description of the power flow.

Some details of the auxiliary systems are as follows.

`tfcpwr` calculates the TF coil power conversion system parameters.  Only the steady-state power consumption for a superconducting TFC system is described here.

The TF current is carried from the power supplies to the reactor by room-temperature aluminium busbars, organised in $N_{circuit}$ circuits.  The total length of the busbars is (somehwat arbitrarily) given by

$$
L_bus = 8 \pi R_0 + (1 + N_{circuit}) (12 R_0 + 80) 
$$

The resistivity of the busbar is 2.62e-8 ohm.m (0.0262 ohm.mmÂ²/m) (hard-coded).

"TF coil resistive power" (`rpower`) includes the dissipation of the cryogenic current leads (assumed to be resistive).

The AC power required is determined by the efficiency of the coil power supply: `etatf` (default = 90%).
